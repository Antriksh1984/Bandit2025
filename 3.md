<h1>Level Goal 2 -> 3</h1>
The password for the next level is stored in a file called --spaces in this filename-- located in the home directory

<h2>Commands</h2>
ls , cd , cat , file , du , find

<h2>Solution</h2>
let's see what files are in directory

```
bandit2@bandit:~$ ls
--spaces in this filename--
bandit2@bandit:~$
```

now, let's use command **cat ./'--spaces in this filename--'** we've used colons ' ' to specify there are spaces in the name

```
bandit2@bandit:~$ cat ./'--spaces in this filename--'

Here's our flag and let's move on to our next level. Remeber, command **exit** to disconnect from machine and then, ssh into next machine as user **bandit3** and password same as the flag above
