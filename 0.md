<h2>Solution</h2>

for ssh; we use following commands

```
ssh user@serveraddress
```

since, we're given a particular port, we'll use **-p** flag, followed by port number, that gives us following command

```
ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```

once you've logged in, type the password **bandit0** and let's move over to our next level
