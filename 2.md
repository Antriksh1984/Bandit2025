<h1>Level Goal 1 -> 2</h1>
The password for the next level is stored in a file called - located in the home directory

Since, the flag from previous level is ZjLjTmM6FvvyRnrb2rfNWOZOTa6ip5If, we'll connect to next server bandit.labs.overthewire.org using username as bandit1 and password as the flag.

```
ssh bandit1@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

<h2>Solution</h2>

first of all, let's look at directory of our server

```
bandit1@bandit:~$ ls
-
bandit1@bandit:~$
```

we can see a file with name -, let's access it using cat

```
bandit1@bandit:~$ cat -
^C
bandit1@bandit:~$ cat ./-
```

it's getting stuck and I've to terminate the process by ctrl + c, else it shows no output

let's try command "cat ./-"

"./" specifies the current directory. It is used to explicitly indicate that the following filename is located within the current working directory, even if the file could be found without it.

```
bandit1@bandit:~$ cat ./-

Congratulations!!! We've found our next flag, login as bandit2 username on our next machine and password as the flag
